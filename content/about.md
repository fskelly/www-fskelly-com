## Who Am I?

I am a Microsoft Employee, working within Azure Engineering as a FastTrack For Azure (FTA) Engineer, focusing primarily on Infra and working with customers across the globe with their respective journeys to the cloud. I was previously a Cloud Solutions Architect (CSA) for Microsoft as well. I was in the Microsoft Partner space for many years before that.

## What is FastTrack For Azure?

FastTrack for Azure is a technical enablement program for organizations with cloud projects that enables the rapid, effective design, and deployment of Azure solutions in the cloud. It includes tailored guidance from Azure engineers that leverages proven practices and architectural guides.

I am constatly testing, changing or adding contnet, I try to get the code/samples as accurate as possible. </br>
