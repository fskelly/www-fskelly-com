So a question I often get asked is "what tools or products do you use?". So I decided to do a post around the tools and technologies that I personally use on a daily basis. So to start this is what people see on my screen on a daily basis.

![VSCode](https://github.com/fskelly/fletchercloud/blob/master/static/images/blogImages/vscodeScreenShot.png?raw=true)

This is my most common tool, Visual Studio Code, the version shown above is actually the Insiders Build. The primary reason for this tool is that is a "container" for other tools and functionality. The extra functionality is enabled with extensions, my most used extensions are as follows:

1. Docker, love my containers.
2. GitLens, used for my source control, all my code is located here for my Azure related code
3. Azure Account (VSCode Extension) , this allows me to run the Azure Cloud Shell from within VSCode, this includes both **PowerShell** and **BASH**.
4. Kubernetes, can't really have Docker without this nowadays :)

Now, aside from Visual Studio Code, I also use the following:  
![WSL](https://github.com/fskelly/fletchercloud/blob/master/static/images/blogImages/terminalScreenShot.png?raw=true)

1. Windows Terminal (Preview), I use this extensively for testing of code and running Docker
2. WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2), I am running the Preview version of this as it is not yet GA, but so far so good.

I use many other applications, however this is my collection of "go-to" tools. This should be in your "cloud arsenal"
