      <description>As a start to this blog post, I think it is important to understand how I see my role as a CSA (Cloud Solution Architect) with my customer. I am primarily a trusted advisor and my customers respect what I have to say, I question and challenge my customers in a constructive way to approach the challenge or problem statement in a different way. I have an amazing role of using Azure as my LEGO playpen and then building a custom solution (LEGO model) to help my customers.</description>

      <description>So a question I often get asked is &amp;ldquo;what tools or products do you use?&amp;rdquo;. So I decided to do a post around the tools and technologies that I personally use on a daily basis. So to start this is what people see on my screen on a daily basis.
This is my most common tool, Visual Studio Code, the version shown above is actually theÂ Insiders Build. The primary reason for this tool is that is a &amp;ldquo;container&amp;rdquo; for other tools and functionality.</description>
