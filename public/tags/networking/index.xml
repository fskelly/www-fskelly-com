      <description>How do I connect my on-premises environment to AVS in a quick and simple way? There are a few patterns available for connecting Azure VMware Solution to your on-premises network. There is specific guidance for PRODUCTION deployments here here. The option we are talking about here is for a different use case.
Specific use case: A PoC (Proof of Concept) type environment or smaller environments for testing with a plan to grow after the fact.</description>

What else do I need to know when using Azure VMware Solution (AVS)?
As you all (probably) know by now Azure VMware Solution is a managed service offered by Microsoft providing a managed VMware vSphere environment to customers. With this offering customers no longer need to worry about hardware maintenance, hardware refresh and software maintenance for the core VMware components (ESXi, vCenter and NSX-T).
By default, after initial deployment of Azure VMware Solution, virtual machines do not have the ability to egress to the Internet.</description>

Often the idea and use case for the customer is correct. There are a few great reasons to use AVS. If you fit within the use cases, you are in for a real treat.</description>

      <description>As a start to this blog post, I think it is important to understand how I see my role as a CSA (Cloud Solution Architect) with my customer. I am primarily a trusted advisor and my customers respect what I have to say, I question and challenge my customers in a constructive way to approach the challenge or problem statement in a different way. I have an amazing role of using Azure as my LEGO playpen and then building a custom solution (LEGO model) to help my customers.</description>
